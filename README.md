# WotlkBestiary

Displays creature ability information in the game tooltip when available. Hold Control while hovering over a unit to display descriptions for spells.

This uses a database generated via scraping wowclassicdb.com/wotlk for creature abilities over the set of units in Questie's database. 

Because of this, some ability tooltips may display incorrect values or might be missing, but if it's there it should be accurate enough to judge what it does. Many creatures are missing ability information and many have some nonsense spells included, so this addon can never be 100% reliable.
